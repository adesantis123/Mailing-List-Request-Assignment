System Administration Service: Mailing list request

This is a web form that allows a user to request a mailing list for marketing and solicitation. The inputs are the type of contact information they want (email, mail, phone) and the class reunion year. The inputs are transformed into SQL statements. The output is a .csv file of all the records and contact info, ready to be mailed.

Propose a systems administration service
As a team, brainstorm two or more meaningful systems administration services suitable to host as a dynamic web application.

Each pitch should appeal to both your organizational partners (e.g. human resources, management, developers) and your customers (i.e., those within and external to your organization who use systems that you administer).

Settle on two or more specific service ideas, and develop a brief "elevator pitch" (~1 paragraph) for each.  (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch.)

After you receive feedback on a proposal from your instructor and a grade on the associated Project assignment, you may complete the next part of the Project.

Additional requirements:

Add one new discussion to this forum with the subject based on your two or more service proposals (abbreviated OK):
team-name member-names: service-title2;  service-title2; ...

(e.g. "Q Mary and Selma: Request super-user permissions; Log work hours")

For each of your two or more pitches, in the single new discussion:
Summarize the elevator pitch
List the inputs (two or more) that you expect to collect for the first step of your solution—describe further any with unclear purpose
Briefly summarize the processing you expect must happen with the inputs to create results
List the outputs you expect to present immediately to the user after processing—describe further any with unclear purpose
